# CI/CD Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Verbose Test Output (800+ lines)
**Problem:** Test runner was outputting one line for every test pass, making CI logs unreadable.

**Solution:** 
- Added `--ci` flag to test_runner.py
- CI mode shows only dots for progress, failures in detail, and summary
- Updated GitHub Actions to use `--ci` flag instead of `--verbose`
- Auto-detects CI environment via `CI` environment variable

### 2. Rich Module Import Error
**Problem:** `test_colors.py` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rich'`

**Solution:**
- Added `rich>=12.0.0` to dev dependencies in pyproject.toml
- Now installed automatically via `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

### 3. Setuptools Missing Error
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools'` when building C extensions

**Solution:**
- Added explicit `python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` in two places:
  1. In the "Install dependencies" step
  2. Before running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`

## Changes Made

### test_runner.py
- Added `ci_mode` parameter to `TimedTextTestResult` and `TimedTextTestRunner`
- Added `--ci` command line flag
- In CI mode:
  - Shows dots (.) for passed tests instead of full output
  - Shows 's' for skipped tests
  - Immediately shows failures and errors with test names
  - Still shows performance summary and coverage report

### pyproject.toml
```toml
dev = [
    ...
    "rich>=12.0.0",  # Added this line
    ...
]
```

### .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml
```yaml
# Changed test command from --verbose to --ci
- name: Run Python tests
  run: |
    python test_runner.py --coverage --ci

# Added setuptools installation
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel  # Added setuptools wheel
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    pip install pytest-cov

# Added setuptools before building
- name: Build Python C extensions (Linux/macOS)
  if: runner.os != 'Windows'
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel  # Added this line
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    ...
```

## Benefits
- CI output reduced from 800+ lines to ~50 lines
- Only shows what matters: failures, errors, and coverage
- All tests now run successfully in CI environment
- Faster CI runs due to less output processing
- Easier to spot actual issues in CI logs
